This is a [connect application](https://marketplace.commercetools.com/) to integrate Braintree into Commercetools.
It follows the folder structure to ensure certification & deployment from commercetools connect team as stated [here](https://github.com/commercetools/connect-application-kit#readme).

## Instructions

* `cd braintree-extension`
* run `yarn` to install the dependencies 
* insert `.env` file from https://access.mediaopt.de/password/edit/73510a78-c1d2-ed11-9d14-005056103f91 (DE) or https://access.mediaopt.de/password/edit/1c6cf552-bf00-ee11-9d14-005056103f91 (US)
* * insert ngrok authtoken with `./node_modules/.bin/ngrok authtoken *your token*`
* run `./bin/ngrok.sh` to start ngrok and insert the dynamic url in the `.env` file
* run `yarn build`
* run `yarn connector:post-deploy` to register the extension with the public ngrok url
* run `á»³arn start:dev` to build the application

## Architecture principles for building a connect application 

* Connector solution should be lightweight in nature
* Connector solutions should follow test driven development. Unit , Integration (& E2E) tests should be included and successfully passed to be used
* No hardcoding of customer related config. If needed, values in an environment file which should not be maintained in repository
* Connector solution should be supported with detailed documentation
* Connectors should be point to point in nature, currently doesnt support any persistence capabilities apart from in memory persistence
* Connector solution should use open source technologies, although connector itself can be private for specific customer(s)
* Code should not contain console.log statements, use [the included logger](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/tree/main/packages-backend/loggers#readme) instead.
